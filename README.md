# Simulation_Optimization_of_Inventory_Management

### Key Points:
•	Estimated long-run mean monthly cost and profit with a 95% CI by simulating (M,L) inventory policy over 100 months

•	Analyzed the main and interaction effect of critical factors such as the value of S, s, and cycle service level (CSL)

•	Implemented simulation optimization to calculate maximum mean monthly profit such that CSL>95%.
